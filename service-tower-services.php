			Marconi doesn’t stop when the final wire is connected. Throughout the entire build process we work extremely hard to find real reductions in construction costs, as well as actively seeking additional tenants to develop vertically on the structure. After the build, we leverage our partnership with SIGFOX to find potential IOT integrations at lease sites. These integrations can automate every day tasks, mitigating or removing daily operating costs. 
		</p>

		<p>
			With annual lease escalators at 3% across the board and fixed long-term leases, Marconi’s drive to add tenancy and reduce operating costs guarantees constantly high ROI in an already profitable sector.
